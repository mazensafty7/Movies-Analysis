In this project, I performed a thorough analysis on a dataset related to movies, focusing on a variety of key factors such as budget, gross earnings, IMDb ratings, and more. The dataset included a range of attributes:

- `color`
- `director_name`
- `movie_title`
- `duration`
- `gross`
- `genres`
- `language`
- `country`
- `content_rating`
- `budget`
- `title_year`
- `imdb_score`
- `movie_facebook_likes`

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- **Null Handling**: Addressed missing values using suitable methods for each column. Numerical values were filled using median or mean, while categorical data was handled through mode imputation or removal when necessary.
- **Column Selection**: Selected key columns from the dataset for analysis, including `color`, `director_name`, `gross`, `budget`, and `imdb_score`.
